### Hi there!

In 2022 I've joined the **EPAM Academy** and learned me some Java.

Now I'm trying to make what I've learned into a portfolio worthy enough to be hired as a Junior Java Developer.

Check out my most advanced project:  
* [SportService](https://github.com/Al-drin/SportService)

I'm focusing on exploring down the Spring rabbit hole and playing with databases.
